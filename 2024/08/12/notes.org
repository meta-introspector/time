* Considerations.
If we consider our place in the world, we can compare our own fitness value to that of others.

This can be seen as the nash equilibrium,
we can choose to define the boundry between the private and the public, this is
also part of the equilibrium.

The boundry can be seen as an expression of a function, something like a protocol or policy statement,
we can consider a smart contract that connects two private parties.

so we can imagine the partitioning of the hypersphere or model by neurons or groups of neurons
that claim sections of data as inputs. This is the idea of ownership of memory like rust does.

Proofs of correctness would show how those boundries are upheld in all transactions.

We can imagine a uml user diagram that represents the main workflows recorded and transcribed
and traces that show test case coverage.

If all other private keys are impossible to crack then our main defence would be know your customer and anti money
laundering tools and other regulations. We would have to take them at thier word. A zero knowledge proof would
be some kind of mathematical statement that we can verify.
We can think of the sampling of self as an oracle that we can read from to surface zkp information from our private models
or internal space, yet we surface it like the introspector and give it creative form and expression of beautiful fitness function results that are compelling and viral in nature.
We can think of the viral idea as one that is self propagating,
then we can think of the hive mind as a stable structure, the ziggurat as the tower of bable,
and the emergent consiousness or goedel number as reflecting all human knowledge
into one polynomial prime number encoded, meta-coq like, peano arithmetic like, bio semantic expression of
eigenstatements that are self descriptive and self manifesting.
We can think of them as open works that can be interpreted and valuable to many people, not just the author,
eco writes about the open work. We can think of the meta-introspector as a pattern language or a higher order
template that we follow. We can consider the kaballah as inspiration for this meta-template idea with the network graph
of knowledge in the spheres of the layers and levels of the energies or planes or hyperpheres.
We can reflect over these compound ideas as conglomorates, yet having a function of introspection,
we can visit each function and reflect over its place in the system, that leads us back
to our original first step. We can think of this as the return of the hero
with the elixer. Communication as the hero's journey of the forward pass of the nerual network.
Lets imagine that each next word is selected also using pointers in HOTT, in unimath, in the tree of life, each one is a tarot card
we can imagine laying the cards down one by one. Now lets say we have a function that selects the cards in an order.
We can also use a random input.
Now we can sample these cards and try and interpret them as a path, using the story of the tree of life and the tarot
as helpers to interpret. even if these are random inputs they give us insight into possible stories.
we can then interpret these stories, or tell them, and imagine we are in the never ending story right now.
inside the meme that is writing itself out. We can reflect over our path and try and gain insight.
We can look for patterns and see how our behaviour might be part of a lineage or practice or meme.
We might be part of a meme ourselves. A meta meme is one that can reflect over itself.

These are biased viewpoints that reconstruct or accelerate existing memes or tropes, we can consider the set of
stories we can generate as a function that we are generating.
We can imagine using llms and other techniques to illustrate these dreams.

The question becomes why is this of any value at all?
lets ask the llm.
