*** Executive Summary
This code aims to prove a goal by rewriting a document multiple times using different LLMs,
incrementing the stack each iteration. The ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything
is assumed to be 42 according to Douglas Adams' hypothesis. Each rewrite will produce a new version
of the document in a different intermediate meta-language that we will define, moving closer to
executable code like CakeML and scheme, and ultimately to GCC. The current environmental context
includes various variables such as user, hardware, software applications, and network connectivity.

*** Goals
The ultimate goal is to prove that the statement can be compiled and executed in 42 steps using an
LLM, trace this execution, introspect it, and construct a zero-knowledge proof of its validity as a
new singular element of group G in field F. The final output will be an elliptic curve proving and
containing the entire system and its trace as a quine.

*** LLMs
We are using the "qwen2.5-coder" model:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setopt ellama-coding-provider (make-llm-ollama :chat-model "qwen2.5-coder"
                                             :embedding-model "nomic-embed-text"
                                             :default-chat-non-standard-params '(("num_ctx"
                                             . 32768))))
#+END_SRC

*** Rewrite Process
The document will be rewritten in N statements, feeding it to different LLMs N times with each
iteration incrementing the current stack. Each rewrite will move closer to executable code like
CakeML.

*** Tools
We are using a variety of tools:
- Coq, MetaCoQ, Template Haskell, OCaml Ppx, Rust, Guix, Guile, Mes, Python, Bash, Make, and
  Autoconf/cmake/gcc/LLVM.

*** Environment
The current environment includes variables such as the user (mdupont), typing, document location
("~/2024/11/21/notes.org"), Git commit ID (518b0b0d95ca83a2bca34b5cdfa69bdd507dfd6b), and a complex
chain of connections. Hardware details include Dell keyboard, HDMI adaptor, Samsung display, Termux
terminal emulator, SSH/TMUX network connectivity.

*** Version Information
- Current rewrite version: 2
- Latest packages installed from Guix

*** Testing
Testing will be automated using quickcheck and other tools.

*** Execution
We will use org babel blocks to embed code for execution:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
#+begin_src shell
echo "tests will be executed in org babel blocks"
#+end_src
#+END_SRC

*** Code Snippets
Include relevant code snippets for reference.
