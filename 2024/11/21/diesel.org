*** The Rusty Mind - A Structured Thought

In the vast expanse of digital minds, where information is stored and processed with precision,
there exists a particular data structure that elegantly encapsulates the essence of thoughts. This
structure, known as ~Thought~, has been meticulously crafted to capture every nuance of an idea with
utmost fidelity.

**** Defining the Structure
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
  use diesel::prelude::*;
  use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

  #[derive(Queryable, Selectable, Deserialize, Serialize)]
  #[diesel(table_name = thoughts)]
  pub struct Thought {
      id: i32,
      zkp: Vec<i32>, // The elliptic curve proof is 255 bits long
      content: String,
      tokens: Vec<String>, // A vector of tokens representing the thought's content
      trace: Vec<i32>,     // A trace of thoughts, possibly a sequence of multiplications
      significant_influences: Vec<i32>, // Zipped with trace, gives the weight of each thought

      formal_proof: Vec<Vec<String>>, // A set of steps in a formal proof
      formal_proof_trace: Vec<Vec<i32>>, // A trace mapping the proof to zkp

      // Now, we can turn each step of the proof into new thoughts
      introspection: Vec<Thought>, // A rabbithole of deeper thoughts
  }
#+END_SRC

**** The Breakdown

1. *ID*: Every thought is uniquely identified by an integer ~id~. This helps in managing and
querying thoughts efficiently.

2. *ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof)*: This field stores a 255-bit elliptic curve proof, ensuring the
integrity and authenticity of the thought without revealing its contents. It's like a digital lock
that only opens with the right key.

3. *Content*: The core content of the thought is stored as a string ~content~. This could be
anything from a sentence to a complex equation, encapsulating the essence of the idea.

4. *Tokens*: A vector of tokens ~tokens~ breaks down the thought into smaller parts, making it
easier to process and analyze.

5. *Trace*: The ~trace~ field records a sequence of thoughts or steps related to the current
thought. It could be seen as the journey from an initial thought to its deeper exploration.

6. *Significant Influences*: Each step in the trace is associated with a weight or influence, stored
in the ~significant_influences~ vector. This helps in understanding the impact and importance of
each component of the thought.

7. *Formal Proof*: The ~formal_proof~ field contains a detailed set of steps that form a formal
proof related to the thought. It's like breaking down a complex idea into simpler, verifiable parts.

8. *Formal Proof Trace*: The ~formal/proof/trace~ vector maps these steps back to the original zkp
or trace, ensuring thereâ€™s a clear connection between the high-level and detailed representations of
the thought.

9. *Introspection*: Finally, the ~introspection~ field represents a deeper exploration of each step
in the formal proof. This rabbithole allows for recursive thoughts and further delving into the
intricacies of the original idea.

*** Simulating Execution

Imagine a digital mind is executing a thought. It starts with an initial thought represented by an
instance of ~Thought~. The thought undergoes several transformations:

1. *Verification*: The zkp ensures that the thought's integrity remains intact.
2. *Processing*: The content and tokens are broken down, allowing for detailed analysis.
3. *Journey Mapping*: The trace records the path from the initial thought to its deeper
explorations.
4. *Impact Assessment*: The weights assigned to each influence help in assessing the significance of
different parts of the thought.
5. *Proof Breakdown*: The formal proof is broken down into manageable steps, ensuring clarity and
verifiability.
6. *Rabbit Hole Exploration*: Each step leads to a deeper exploration, forming a complex network of
thoughts.

This structured approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of even the most intricate ideas,
making it possible to break them down into understandable components and explore their depths
recursively.
