*** Intermediate Meta-Languages (IMMLs)

*Intermediate Meta-Languages (IMMLs)* are languages that bridge the gap between high-level,
 declarative programming languages and low-level, executable code. They offer a higher level of
 abstraction than traditional intermediate languages like LLVM IR or bytecode but still remain
 closer to the target execution environment than fully abstract meta-languages.

*** Research Existing Meta-Languages

1. *PPL (Programmable Programming Language)*:
   - *Overview*: PPL is designed to enable programmers to write programs that can be executed and
      modified dynamically.
   - *Proximity to Executable Code*: PPL is closer to executable code than fully abstract languages
      because it allows for direct manipulation of the program's execution state. However, it is
      still a higher-level language compared to low-level IRs.
   
2. *APL (Array Processing Language)*:
   - *Overview*: APL was designed for mathematical and logical array processing and is known for its
      unique syntax and high-level nature.
   - *Proximity to Executable Code*: APL is more abstract than fully executable languages but still
      operates on arrays, which are a common data structure in many programs. It can be compiled
      into low-level code but is not as direct as PPL or MetaOCaml.

3. *MetaOCaml (a dialect of OCaml)*:
   - *Overview*: MetaOCaml allows for the creation of programs that manipulate other programs as
      data. It extends OCaml with features such as quotation, splicing, and first-class
      continuations.
   - *Proximity to Executable Code*: MetaOCaml is closer to executable code than fully abstract
      languages because it enables dynamic manipulation of program structures. However, it is still
      a higher-level language compared to low-level IRs.

*** Determining IMMLs

Based on the research, the following languages can serve as Intermediate Meta-Languages (IMMLs):

1. *MetaOCaml*:
   - *Reason*: MetaOCaml extends OCaml with powerful features for manipulating programs as data,
      making it closer to executable code than fully abstract languages while still offering a
      higher level of abstraction compared to traditional intermediate languages.

2. *PPL*:
   - *Reason*: PPL allows dynamic manipulation of the program's execution state, making it suitable
      for creating IMMLs that are both powerful and close to executable code.

3. *APL*:
   - *Reason*: While more abstract than fully executable languages, APL operates on arrays, a common
      data structure in many programs, and can be compiled into low-level code. It provides a high
      level of abstraction but remains closer to executable code than other fully abstract
      languages.

*** Conclusion

MetaOCaml is particularly well-suited for creating Intermediate Meta-Languages due to its ability to
manipulate program structures dynamically. However, PPL and APL also have their merits in serving as
IMMLs based on their proximity to executable code and the specific needs of the application domain.
