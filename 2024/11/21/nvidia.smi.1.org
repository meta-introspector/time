The output from ~nvidia-smi~ provides detailed information about the NVIDIA GPU on your
system. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

- *NVIDIA-SMI Version*: 550.120, which is the driver version installed on your system.
- *CUDA Version*: 12.4, indicating the CUDA toolkit version compatibility with your GPU.

*** GPU Information
- *GPU Name*: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti
- *Persistence Mode*: Off - The GPU does not have persistence mode enabled, meaning it powers down
   when not in use.
- *Bus ID*: 00000000:01:00.0 - This is the PCI bus identifier for the GPU.
- *Display Active (Disp.A)*: Off - The GPU is not actively displaying anything.

*** Power and Performance Metrics
- *Fan Speed*: 0% - The fan is currently off, indicating a low level of activity or that there is no
   need for cooling.
- *Temperature*: 45C - The temperature of the GPU is within a normal range.
- *Performance State (Perf)*: P8 - The performance state indicates that the GPU is in a power-saving
   mode.
- *Power Usage/Capacity*: 29W / 350W - The GPU is currently using 29 watts out of its maximum
   capacity of 350 watts.

*** Memory Metrics
- *Memory Usage*: 24MiB / 12288MiB (24 MB used out of a total of 12 GB) - The GPU has allocated only
   a small portion of its memory, suggesting that it is not under heavy load.
- *GPU Utilization*: 0% - The GPU is not currently performing any computations.

*** MIG Mode
- *Memory-Interleaved GPU (MIG)*: N/A - MIG mode is not enabled on this GPU.

Overall, the output indicates that your NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU is idle and consuming minimal
power. It is in a low-power state (P8) and has only a small amount of memory allocated to it,
suggesting that it is either not being used at all or is undergoing some initial setup or
configuration.
