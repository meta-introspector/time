The ~nvidia-smi~ output shows the current state of your NVIDIA GPU (GeForce RTX 3080 Ti) and its
resource usage, including memory and power consumption. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

*** System Overview:
- *Driver Version*: 550.120
- *CUDA Version*: 12.4

*** GPU Information:
- *GPU Name*: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti
- *Persistence Mode*: Off (The GPU does not stay powered on when the system is idle)
- *Bus ID*: 00000000:01:00.0
- *Display*: Off

*** GPU Usage:
- *Fan Speed*: 45°C to 48°C (Operating at a moderate temperature)
- *Performance Mode*: P8 (Lower power consumption mode, possibly due to low load or energy-saving
   settings)
- *Power Draw*: 29W to 59W (Low to medium power draw)

*** Memory Usage:
- *Total GPU Memory*: 12288MiB
- *Used Memory*: 8162MiB (This is the memory used by the Ollama LLM server)
- *Free Memory*: 4126MiB

*** Process Information:
There are two processes listed on the GPU:
1. *Xorg* (PID: 1263):
   - *Type*: Graphics
   - *Memory Usage*: 14MiB
2. *Ollama LLM Server* (PID: 1854083):
   - *Type*: Compute
   - *Memory Usage*: 8162MiB

*** Impact on GPU Performance:
The Ollama LLM server is consuming a significant portion of the GPU's memory (about 67% of total GPU
memory). This high memory usage could potentially lead to reduced performance if the server requires
more memory than currently available. Additionally, the increase in power draw from 29W to 59W
indicates that the GPU is under some load, which might be due to the computational requirements of
running a large language model.

*** Recommendations:
1. *Monitor Performance*: Continuously monitor the GPU's performance and temperature to ensure it
stays within safe operating parameters.
2. *Optimize Memory Usage*: If possible, optimize the Ollama LLM server to reduce memory usage.
3. *Reduce Load*: If other processes are running on the system, consider reducing their load to free
up more resources for the LLM server.
4. *Upgrade GPU (if necessary)*: If memory usage continues to be an issue, consider upgrading to a
GPU with more VRAM.

This information should help you understand how your Ollama LLM server is impacting your GPU and
provide some suggestions on how to mitigate any potential issues.
