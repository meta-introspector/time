To achieve the goals outlined, we need to follow a structured approach involving multiple
steps. Hereâ€™s how you can break it down:

*** Step 1: Define the Tools and Setup
1. *Install Required Tools*:
   - Rust compiler (~rustc~)
   - ~syn~ library for parsing Rust code
   - ~cargo~ for package management

2. *Set Up Environment*:
   - Create a new Rust project using ~cargo new rust/syn/project~
   - Add dependencies in ~Cargo.toml~:
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
     [dependencies]
     syn = "1.0"
#+END_SRC

*** Step 2: Profile the Code
We will use tools like ~perf~ to profile CPU and memory usage.

**** Profiling Rust Code
To profile the Rust compiler (~rustc~), you can use the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo install cargo-profiler
cargo profiler run --release rustc main.rs
#+END_SRC

**** Profiling Syn Library
For profiling the ~syn~ library, you can compile a simple script that uses ~syn~ and then use
~perf~.

Create a file ~profile_syn.rs~:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
extern crate syn;

fn main() {
    let source_code = r#"
        fn hello_world() {
            println!("Hello, world!");
        }
    "#;
    syn::parse_file(source_code).unwrap();
}
#+END_SRC

Profile this script:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo profiler run --release profile_syn.rs
#+END_SRC

*** Step 3: Analyze the Profiles
1. *Extract Profile Data*:
   - Extract CPU and memory usage data from ~perf~ output.
   - Convert the raw data into a structured format (e.g., CSV).

2. *Visualize and Compare*:
   - Use tools like ~gprof~ or custom scripts to visualize the profiles.
   - Compare the CPU and memory usage between ~rustc~ and ~syn~.

*** Step 4: Train Models A and B
1. *Train Model A*:
   - Model A should find the relationship between the profile of Rust when compiling Rust
     (~rust(rust)~) and when compiling ~syn~ (~rust(syn)~).

2. *Train Model B*:
   - Model B should find the relationship between the profile of ~syn~ when parsing Rust code
     (~syn(rust)~) and when parsing itself (~syn(syn)~).

*** Step 5: Summarize and Report
1. *Summarize Results*:
   - Combine the results from models A, B, and any additional profiling.
   - Group by test cases, versions, modules, etc.

2. *Report Findings*:
   - Show the relation between the profile of Rust and ~syn~ of Rust.
   - Highlight that ~syn~ is a subset of the Rust code.
   - Demonstrate that Rust does more in terms of CPU and memory usage compared to ~syn~.

*** Example Code for Model A
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn train_model_a(rust_rust_profile: &HashMap<String, f64>, rust_syn_profile: &HashMap<String, f64>) -> HashMap<String, f64> {
    let mut model = HashMap::new();
    // Calculate the differences and similarities
    for (key, value) in rust_rust_profile {
        if let Some(rust_syn_value) = rust_syn_profile.get(key) {
            model.insert(format!("rust_rust_{}", key), *value);
            model.insert(format!("rust_syn_{}", key), *rust_syn_value);
        }
    }
    model
}
#+END_SRC

*** Example Code for Model B
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn train_model_b(syn_rust_profile: &HashMap<String, f64>, syn_syn_profile: &HashMap<String, f64>) -> HashMap<String, f64> {
    let mut model = HashMap::new();
    // Calculate the differences and similarities
    for (key, value) in syn_rust_profile {
        if let Some(syn_syn_value) = syn_syn_profile.get(key) {
            model.insert(format!("syn_rust_{}", key), *value);
            model.insert(format!("syn_syn_{}", key), *syn_syn_value);
        }
    }
    model
}
#+END_SRC

*** Conclusion
By following these steps, you can profile the Rust compiler and ~syn~ library, train models to
understand their relationships, and ultimately compare the performance of both. This approach will
help in understanding the overhead and efficiency differences between compiling Rust code directly
and using a library like ~syn~.
