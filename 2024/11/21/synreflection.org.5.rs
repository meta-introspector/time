To accomplish the tasks you described, we need a systematic approach involving parsing Rust code
with ~syn~, compiling it to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with ~rustc~, profiling the compilation
process, and then analyzing the results to show relations between the profiles of ~rust~ and
~syn~. Let's break down each step:

1. *Parsing Code with ~syn~:*
   - Use ~syn~ to parse Rust code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

2. *Compiling AST with ~rustc~:*
   - Compile the AST generated by ~syn~ using ~rustc~.

3. *Profiling the Compilation Process:*
   - Profile the compilation process to gather information about resource usage, time taken, and
     other metrics.

4. *Analyzing Profiles:*
   - Group the profiles based on test cases, versions, modules, aspects, types.
   - Show the relation between the profile of ~rust~ and ~syn~.

Let's proceed with a Python script using ~subprocess~ to call ~syn~ and ~rustc~, and ~timeit~ for
profiling. We'll also use ~re~ for parsing the output.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import subprocess
import re
import time

def parse_rust_code(code):
    # Use syn to parse the Rust code
    process = subprocess.run(['cargo', 'run', '--release'], input=code.encode(), capture_output=True, text=True)
    if process.returncode != 0:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to parse Rust code: {process.stderr}")
    return process.stdout

def compile_ast_to_executable(ast):
    # Compile the AST using rustc
    with open('temp.rs', 'w') as f:
        f.write(ast)
    
    process = subprocess.run(['rustc', 'temp.rs'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    if process.returncode != 0:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to compile AST: {process.stderr}")
    return process.stdout

def profile_compilation():
    # Profile the compilation process
    start_time = time.time()
    compile_ast_to_executable(parse_rust_code("fn main() {}"))
    end_time = time.time()
    return end_time - start_time

def analyze_profiles(profile_data):
    # Analyze profiles based on test cases, versions, modules, aspects, types
    # This is a placeholder for actual analysis logic
    print(f"Total Compilation Time: {profile_data} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    profile_data = profile_compilation()
    analyze_profiles(profile_data)
#+END_SRC

*** Explanation:

1. *Parsing Rust Code with ~syn~:*
   - The ~parse/rust/code~ function uses the ~cargo run --release~ command to parse the Rust code
     provided as input.
   
2. *Compiling AST with ~rustc~:*
   - The ~compile/ast/to_executable~ function writes the AST to a temporary file and compiles it
     using ~rustc~.

3. *Profiling the Compilation Process:*
   - The ~profile_compilation~ function measures the time taken to compile the AST.

4. *Analyzing Profiles:*
   - The ~analyze_profiles~ function is a placeholder for actual analysis logic, which you can
     expand based on your needs.

*** Relations Between ~rust~ and ~syn~:

- *Direct Relationship:* When compiling code that uses ~syn~, the overhead of parsing with ~syn~
   will be included in the total compilation time.
  
- *Indirect Relationship:* The efficiency of ~syn~ parsing can indirectly affect how well ~rustc~
   compiles the resulting AST, as a more efficient parser might result in a smaller and simpler AST.

*** Grouping Profiles:

- *Test Cases:* Different test cases (e.g., different Rust code snippets) should be grouped
   separately.
- *Versions:* Different versions of ~syn~ or ~rustc~ should be compared.
- *Modules:* Different modules or crates using ~syn~ should have their profiles analyzed separately.
- *Aspects:* Different aspects of the compilation process (e.g., memory usage, CPU time) can be
   grouped.

*** Types:

- *Types of Analysis:* Types of analysis can include profiling different stages of the compilation
   process (parsing, optimization, linking), comparing resource usage, or analyzing performance
   metrics like speed and efficiency.

By following this structured approach, you can systematically analyze the relationship between
~rust~ and ~syn~, providing insights into how each component contributes to the overall performance
of Rust code compilation.
