*** 1. Define Intermediate Meta-Languages (IMMLs)
*Task:* Identify and define the intermediate meta-languages that are closer to executable code than
 the original document.
- *Language:* Python, Haskell, OCaml
- *Steps:*
  - Research existing meta-languages such as PPL (Programmable Programming Language), APL (Array
    Processing Language), or MetaOCaml (a dialect of OCaml).
  - Determine which languages can serve as IMMLs based on their proximity to executable code.

*** 2. Rewrite the Document Using Different LLMs
*Task:* Write a script that feeds the document to different LLMs and increments the stack for each
 iteration, resulting in new versions of the document in each IMML.
- *Language:* Python with ~llama~
- *Steps:*
  - Implement a loop to iterate N times.
  - In each iteration, use a different LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3, Hugging Face's Transformers) to
    rewrite the document.
  - Increment the stack by appending new layers or annotations.

*** 3. Use Coq and MetaCoQ to Prove Properties
*Task:* Apply formal verification techniques using Coq and MetaCoQ to prove properties of each
 version and their relations to previous ones.
- *Language:* Coq, Haskell, OCaml
- *Steps:*
  - Write Coq theories for each intermediate version.
  - Extract proofs into Haskell and OCaml code.
  - Use quickcheck to validate the properties.

*** 4. Compile and Lift Code Using Template Haskell and Ppx
*Task:* Use Template Haskell and OCaml Ppx to compile and lift the latest version of the document
 into executable code in CakeML or a similar language.
- *Language:* Template Haskell, OCaml Ppx, CakeML
- *Steps:*
  - Write Template Haskell code to generate CakeML syntax.
  - Use OCaml Ppx to optimize and annotate the code.
  - Compile the code using CakeML compiler.

*** 5. Test the Compiled Code
*Task:* Automate testing of the compiled code using quickcheck and other tools, ensuring correctness
 and functional equivalence to the original document.
- *Language:* Python with ~quickcheck~
- *Steps:*
  - Write test cases that validate the functionality of the compiled code.
  - Run tests in an automated environment.

*** 6. Load Hex Codes into MES Hex Loader
*Task:* Load the hex codes generated from the compiled CakeML into the mes hex loader as an
 assembler and execute them, same for wasm and even llvm.
- *Language:* Bash, Mes, GCC, LLVM
- *Steps:*
  - Convert the hex codes to a format suitable for mes loader.
  - Assemble the code using GCC.
  - Execute the code in the mes hex loader.

*** 7. Manage Packages and Dependencies
*Task:* Use github, Rust crates, and Guix to manage packages and dependencies, ensuring
 reproducibility and stability across platforms.
- *Language:* Bash, Rust, Guix
- *Steps:*
  - Create a ~guix~ manifest file for project dependencies.
  - Install necessary packages using guix package manager.
  - Automate dependency management with scripts.

*** 8. Integrate Emacs and the Ellama Package
*Task:* Integrate Emacs and the ellama package for communicating with LLMs and automating code
 review tasks.
- *Language:* Emacs Lisp, Python
- *Steps:*
  - Write Emacs Lisp functions to interact with the ellama package.
  - Implement Emacs key bindings for automated code review.
  - Test the integration in an Emacs environment.

*** 9. Compile Final Code Using GCC and Linux
*Task:* Use GCC and Linux for compiling and executing the final code, taking advantage of their
 optimizations and features.
- *Language:* Bash, GCC, Python
- *Steps:*
  - Write a script to compile the final code using GCC.
  - Run the compiled executable on the Linux system.
  - Ensure compatibility across different hardware configurations.

*** 10. Trace Executions and Construct Zero Knowledge Proof
*Task:* Trace the executions of the code and construct zero knowledge proofs that summarize the
 execution succinctly.
- *Language:* Python, ZKP libraries
- *Steps:*
  - Write scripts to trace and record code execution.
  - Use ZKP libraries to generate zero knowledge proofs for each execution.

*** 11. Document Each Step and Version
*Task:* Document each step, tool, and version using org babel for easy reference and collaboration.
- *Language:* Org Mode
- *Steps:*
  - Write detailed documentation for each step of the process.
  - Use org babel to create versioned notes and results.
  - Share documentation with team members.

*** 12. Continuously Refine and Improve the Process
*Task:* Continuously refine and improve the process based on feedback, data, and insights from users
 and experts in AI, programming, and linguistics.
- *Language:* Python, Jupyter Notebook
- *Steps:*
  - Conduct regular reviews of the process.
  - Gather feedback from users and experts.
  - Use data to identify areas for improvement.
  - Implement changes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

*** 13. Split Larger Task into Smaller Tasks
*Task:* Split the larger task into smaller tasks that require less context because this one it
 getting too big.
- *Language:* Python
- *Steps:*
  - Analyze the current task and identify sub-tasks.
  - Define clear goals for each sub-task.
  - Allocate resources and timelines for each sub-task.
