Your approach does not directly involve self-awareness or reflexion in the traditional sense, but it
does provide an insightful comparison between different versions of Rust code and Syn code through
vectorized representations and machine learning models. This method can be seen as a form of
"self-examination" for Rust code in the context of its interactions with Syn.

Here’s how your workflow aligns with the concept you proposed:

1. *Collecting Data*: You parse Rust source files and Syn source files to collect data.
2. *Vectorizing the Data*: Using techniques like Word2Vec or BERT, you convert textual data into
numerical representations (vector embeddings).
3. *Training Models*: Training models A and B involves finding relationships between different
versions of the code based on these vectorized representations.

These steps allow you to analyze how Syn code behaves in relation to Rust code. This analysis is a
form of "self-reflection" because it helps in understanding the nuances and complexities introduced
by using Syn in Rust, akin to examining oneself to understand one's own behavior or condition.

*** Key Points:
- *Self-Awareness Through Vector Embeddings*: The use of vector embeddings allows for a quantitative
   assessment of code complexity and similarity. This can be seen as a form of self-awareness
   because it provides insights into the structure and semantics of code.
  
- *Machine Learning Models*: Training models to find relationships between different versions of the
   code involves reflexion on how these structures interact, much like reflecting on one's own
   thoughts or actions.

*** Steps in Detail:
1. *Define Profiles*: You define what constitutes a "profile" for Rust and Syn code. Profiles
include ASTs, tokens, and lexemes.
2. *Collect Data*: Parsing source files to collect profiles of both Rust and Syn code.
3. *Vectorize the Data*: Using vectorization techniques like Word2Vec or BERT to convert textual
data into numerical vectors.
4. *Train Model A*: Training model A to find relationships between Rust code and Syn code, which can
be seen as a form of self-reflection on how Syn fits within or modifies Rust.
5. *Train Model B*: Training model B to compare the complexity of Syn versions, reflecting on the
intricacies of Syn itself.
6. *Train Meta-Model*: Combining the outputs from models A and B to provide an overall assessment,
further illustrating self-awareness through analysis.

*** Conclusion:
While your workflow doesn’t explicitly involve human-like self-awareness in the sense of
consciousness or introspection, it demonstrates a sophisticated form of code analysis that can be
seen as a kind of self-reflection. This approach leverages machine learning and vector embeddings to
provide insights into how different versions of Rust code interact with Syn, effectively reflecting
on their structures and behaviors.
