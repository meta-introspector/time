It looks like you're defining a Rust struct for a database table named "downloads" using the Diesel
ORM. The ~#[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]~ attribute helps Diesel automatically generate
implementations for retrieving data from and inserting data into this table. Here's a breakdown of
what each part of your struct means:

- ~id: i32~: This is the primary key of the table, likely used to uniquely identify each download
  record.
- ~version_id: i32~: This field probably references another table or entity (likely version
  information) and might be used to link a specific download to its corresponding version.
- ~downloads: i32~: This field would store the number of times this particular download has been
  accessed.
- ~counted: i32~: This could indicate whether the download count has already been updated or if it
  still needs counting (e.g., for periodic batch updates).
- ~date: SystemTime~: This is a timestamp field that records when the record was created, possibly
  representing when the download occurred.

The ~#[diesel(table_name = downloads)]~ attribute tells Diesel to map this Rust struct to the
"downloads" table in your database.
