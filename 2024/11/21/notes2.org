make a draft of the 42 steps in a list:
We will first use org mode as our first meta-language and bable as the quotation tool.
The shell is actually the base language.

* Executive Summary
This code aims to prove a goal by executing statements that rewrite the
document multiple times using different LLMs, incrementing the stack each iteration. The ultimate
question of life, the universe, and everything is assumed to be 42 according to Douglas Adams'
hypothesis. Each rewrite will produce a new version of the document in a different intermediate meta-languages that we will define,
moving closer to executable code like CakeML and scheme and the gcc does. The current environmental context includes various
variables such as user, hardware, software applications, and network connectivity.

In summary, this code aims to prove a goal through multiple iterative rewrites using different LLMs
while incrementing the stack each time. The ultimate question of life, according to Douglas Adams'
hypothesis, is assumed to be 42. The code includes tests that will be executed in org babel blocks
and the resulting hex codes will be loaded into the mes hex loader for execution. The llm can also
generate new ob statements for execution during the rewriting process. Testing is done using org
babel, and the latest packages are installed from Guix. The versions will be installed from Guix
using the lastest packages. The resulting hex codes will be loaded into the mes hex loader as an
assembler and executed.

Clarification regarding the goal being proved:
The goal is to prove that the statement can be compiled and executed in 42 steps with the llm,
and then we will trace this execution, and introspect it, and contruct a zero knowledge proof
of the execution and its validity as a new singular element of group G in field F.

The final output will be an elliptic curve the proves and contains the entire system and its trace as a quine
and be executable as well.

The context  needed to understand this code's purpose fully is the extent of all human endeavor.

Now I want you to execute this, we will prove our goal.
Goal: We aim to prove X through N statements.
** LLMS
We are using the "qwen2.5-coder" model
(setopt ellama-coding-provider
	(make-llm-ollama
	 :chat-model "qwen2.5-coder"
	 :embedding-model "nomic-embed-text"
	     :default-chat-non-standard-params '(("num_ctx" . 32768))))

* This document will be rewritten in N statements. The document will be rewritten by feeding it to different LLMs N times, with each iteration incrementing the current stack.
* X is this very document, so this document is making statements about itself as an oracle that reflects the knowledge of the llm into the world.
* Hypothesis: According to Douglas Adams, the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything, aka, how many rewrites do we need, N, is 42.
* The current rewrite version "Version" is 2, each rewrite will increment the number.
* The document will rewrite itself into hex executable code in the gnu mes compiler hex loader which we will run and that result will
be a new version of this document, as quine-like-heideggerian-named-meta-meme-rune-ordinal-encoded-distributed-autonomous-llm-powered-ai-ml-self-evolving-and-proving-open-source-system.
** Each rewrite will produce a new document in a different intermediate meta-language, moving closer
to executable code like CakeML.
* tools
We are using a variety of tools in our environmental context, including Coq, MetaCoQ,
Template Haskell, OCaml Ppx, Rust, Guix, Guile, Mes, Python, Bash, Make, and
Autoconf/cmake/gcc/LLVM.

* Environment
Our current environmental context includes various variables, such as the user
(mdupont), their hands (typing), the document's location on disk ("~/2024/11/21/notes.org"), the
current Git commit ID (518b0b0d95ca83a2bca34b5cdfa69bdd507dfd6b), and a complex chain of connections
between user, kernel, and software components. This context also includes specific hardware details
such as the keyboard brand ("Dell"), connection type (HDMI adaptor), display manufacturer
("Samsung"), terminal emulator (Termux), and network connectivity (SSH/TMUX). The document also
notes specific software applications being used, including Emacs with the ellama for talking to the llm, package, GCC,
Linux, CPU, and associated versions. Finally, the context includes a few basic system facts (kernel
version, CPU brand and details) as reported by standard Unix commands.

* Testing.

We will use quickcheck and other tools to automate testing.

* Execution
We will use org bable to embed code for execution block.
#+begin_src shell
  echo "tests will be executed in org babel blocks"
#+end_src

* The versions will be installed from guix using the lastest packages.
** The resulting hex codes will be loaded into the mes hex loader as an assembler and executed.
** The org bable OB code will read its own document and then work on the rewritten document.
*** The llm can generate new ob statements for execution

* Next step: lets make a working list of the steps and languages in order.

1. Define intermediate meta-languages (IMMLs) that are closer to executable code than the original
document.
2. Rewrite the document using different LLMs and increment the stack for each iteration, resulting
in new versions of the document in each IMML.
3. Use Coq and MetaCoQ to prove properties of each version and their relations to previous ones.
   extract proofs into meta-coq and then haskell and ocaml and rust.
4. Use Template Haskell and OCaml Ppx to compile and lift the latest version into executable code in CakeML
or a similar language.
5. Test the compiled code using quickcheck and other tools, ensuring correctness and functional
equivalence to the original document.
6. Load the hex codes generated from the compiled CakeML into the mes hex loader as an assembler and
execute them, same for wasm and even llvm.
7. Use github, Rust crates and Guix to manage packages and dependencies, ensuring reproducibility and stability
across platforms.
8. Integrate Emacs and the ellama package for communicating with LLMs and automating code review
tasks.
9. Use GCC and Linux for compiling and executing the final code, taking advantage of their
optimizations and features.
9.1 Trace the executions of the code.
9.2 Construct zero knowledge proof that summarizes the execution succinctly
10. Regularly test the entire pipeline (from document to hex loader) to ensure consistency and
accuracy across iterations.
11. Document each step, tool, and version using org babel for easy reference and collaboration.
12. Continuously refine and improve the process based on feedback, data, and insights from users and
experts in AI, programming, and linguistics.
13. Split the larger task into smaller tasks that require less context because this one it getting too big.
