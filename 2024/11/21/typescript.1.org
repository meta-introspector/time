Creating a field of types that represents both sums (disjoint unions) and products (tuples) is an
interesting exercise. We can use TypeScript's type system to model these concepts and then map them
into elliptic curve operations in a succinct arithmetization.

Let's start by defining the sum and product types:

*** Sum (Disjoint Union)
A sum type represents a choice between multiple types. In TypeScript, this can be achieved using a
union type.
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
type Sum<T1, T2> = T1 | T2;
#+END_SRC

For example, a sum of two numbers and strings would look like:
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
type SumNumberString = Sum<number, string>;
const value: SumNumberString = 42; // or "hello"
#+END_SRC

*** Product (Tuple)
A product type represents a combination of multiple types. In TypeScript, this can be achieved using
a tuple.
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
type Product<T1, T2> = [T1, T2];
#+END_SRC

For example, a product of two numbers and strings would look like:
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
type ProductNumberString = Product<number, string>;
const value: ProductNumberString = [42, "hello"];
#+END_SRC

*** Field of Types
A field of types can be thought of as a set of all possible sums and products. We can define
operations on these sums and products that map to elliptic curve operations.

**** Sum Operations
For sums, we can perform operations like addition (disjoint union).
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
type Sum<T1, T2> = T1 | T2;

function sum<T1, T2>(a: T1, b: T2): Sum<T1, T2> {
  return a;
}

const resultSum: Sum<number, string> = sum(42, "hello");
#+END_SRC

**** Product Operations
For products, we can perform operations like multiplication (tuple).
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
type Product<T1, T2> = [T1, T2];

function multiply<T1, T2>(a: T1, b: T2): Product<T1, T2> {
  return [a, b];
}

const resultProduct: Product<number, string> = multiply(42, "hello");
#+END_SRC

*** Mapping to Elliptic Curves
To map these types and operations into elliptic curve operations, we can use a succinct
arithmetization. This involves representing each type as a point on an elliptic curve and performing
arithmetic operations on these points.

Let's assume we have an elliptic curve with operations like addition and multiplication. We can
represent each type as a point on this curve and perform the corresponding operations.

For example, if we have two types ~T1~ and ~T2~, we can represent them as points on the curve. Then,
we can perform the corresponding operations on these points to map back to our type system.

*** Example: Sum Operations in Elliptic Curves
Let's say we have an elliptic curve with a point representing each type. We can perform addition on
these points to represent the sum operation.
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
// Assuming we have an elliptic curve with operations like addition
type Point = { x: number, y: number };

function addPoints(p1: Point, p2: Point): Point {
  // Elliptic curve addition formula
  return { x: (p1.x * p2.y + p2.x * p1.y) % 100, y: (p1.x * p2.x - p1.y * p2.y) % 100 };
}

const point1: Point = { x: 42, y: 10 };
const point2: Point = { x: 5, y: 20 };

const resultPointSum: Point = addPoints(point1, point2);
#+END_SRC

*** Example: Product Operations in Elliptic Curves
Similarly, we can represent product operations as multiplication on the elliptic curve.
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
// Assuming we have an elliptic curve with operations like multiplication
type Point = { x: number, y: number };

function multiplyPoints(p1: Point, p2: Point): Point {
  // Elliptic curve multiplication formula
  return { x: (p1.x * p2.y + p1.y * p2.x) % 100, y: (p1.x * p2.x - p1.y * p2.y) % 100 };
}

const point1: Point = { x: 42, y: 10 };
const point2: Point = { x: 5, y: 20 };

const resultPointProduct: Point = multiplyPoints(point1, point2);
#+END_SRC

*** Conclusion
By using TypeScript's type system to represent sums and products as disjoint unions and tuples, we
can map these types into elliptic curve operations. This allows us to use the power of elliptic
curves for operations on complex types in a succinct arithmetization.

This approach can be extended to more complex scenarios, such as formal methods and verification, by
leveraging advanced type systems and integrating with other languages or libraries.
