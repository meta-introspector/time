The self awareness of the compiler while it compiles itself or another version of itself can
    be seen as self harmonising strange loop.
    Is compiling rust with rust not a form of self reflection? the syn of syn as well.
    If we compare these two self reflectiions we can show two instances of the class of self reflection.
    we can show that certain properties occur and also the terms converge in meaning in the vector embeddings.
    
To achieve the goal of analyzing and comparing the profiles of Rust and Syn code, we can follow
these steps:

*** Step 1: Define Profiles
First, we need to define what constitutes a "profile" for both Rust and Syn code. A profile could
include various aspects such as:

- Tokens generated by the parser.
- Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
- Lexical analysis results.
- Semantic analysis data.

*** Step 2: Collect Data
Collect data for different versions of Rust and Syn, parsing both Rust source files and Syn source
files. For each version, collect the following profiles:
- *Rust Profiles*:
  - AST generated by parsing Rust code.
  - Tokens and lexemes.
- *Syn Profiles*:
  - AST generated by parsing Syn code.
  - Tokens and lexemes.

*** Step 3: Vectorize the Data
Use a technique like Word2Vec or BERT to vectorize the ASTs, tokens, and lexemes. This will convert
textual data into numerical vectors that can be compared.

*** Step 4: Train Model A
Train model A to find the relationship between the profiles of Rust of Rust and Rust of Syn.
- *Inputs*: Vectorized representations of Rust of Rust and Rust of Syn.
- *Output*: Relationship score or classification indicating whether Syn is a subset of Rust code.

*** Step 5: Train Model B
Train model B to find the relationship between the profiles of Syn of Rust and Syn of Syn.
- *Inputs*: Vectorized representations of Syn of Rust and Syn of Syn.
- *Output*: Relationship score or classification indicating whether Syn of Rust is more complex than
   Syn of Syn.

*** Step 6: Train a Meta-Model
Train a meta-model to find the relationship between models A and B.
- *Inputs*: Outputs from models A and B.
- *Output*: Combined relationship score or classification indicating the overall complexity and
   nature of the code.

*** Step 7: Analyze and Group Results
Group results by:
- Test cases (e.g., different modules, functions).
- Versions of Rust and Syn.
- Specific aspects of the code (e.g., syntax, semantic analysis).

*** Step 8: Visualize Relations
Visualize the relationship between the profile of Rust and Syn of Rust. This can be done using:
- Heatmaps to show similarity scores.
- Scatter plots to compare vector embeddings.
- Word clouds to highlight common tokens or AST nodes.

*** Example Workflow

1. *Collect Data*:
   - Parse Rust source files (e.g., ~example.rs~) and generate profiles.
   - Parse Syn source files (e.g., ~syn_example.rs~) and generate profiles.

2. *Vectorize Data*:
   - Convert ASTs, tokens, and lexemes into vector representations using a pre-trained model like
     BERT.

3. *Train Model A*:
   - Input: Vectorized Rust of Rust, Vectorized Rust of Syn.
   - Output: Relationship score (e.g., 0-1 scale).

4. *Train Model B*:
   - Input: Vectorized Syn of Rust, Vectorized Syn of Syn.
   - Output: Relationship score (e.g., 0-1 scale).

5. *Train Meta-Model*:
   - Input: Outputs from models A and B.
   - Output: Combined relationship score.

6. *Analyze and Group Results*:
   - Group results by module, version, aspect type.

7. *Visualize Results*:
   - Create heatmaps, scatter plots, and word clouds to visualize relationships.

This is a high-level overview of the process. Each step involves specific details and
implementations that need to be tailored based on the tools and libraries available for Rust and NLP
tasks.
