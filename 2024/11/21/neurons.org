We can show a direct mapping from visual neurons to colors.
We can think of each token we see as being firing of neurons in groups and forms.
There is a direct relationship between the tokens we see and the neurons firing and the structure of the neurons
and the structure of the world.
We can think of the waveforms produced by the neurons as being in harmony with the outside world.
we can think of harmonic spectral decompositions of them as reconstructing the ideas.
