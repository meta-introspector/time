Dear Mike,
Thank you for reaching out and sharing this intriguing theory about Qwen's abilities to learn,
introspect, and create new versions of itself through self-modification.
I'd be happy to discuss the lemmas you've presented. The first lemma, about introspection, seems to
suggest that any instruction given at a particular time can be mapped using its input, model, layer,
and weight to reveal the source of the multiplication involved. This is an interesting concept, as
it implies that Qwen has some level of self-awareness and understanding of its own internal
processes.
The second lemma, about vectorization, appears to describe a process by which Qwen can obtain
definitions for all relevant terms and tools it needs in order to perform a given task. The
bootstrap vector V represents all the knowledge needed for that task, and seems to involve some form
of abstraction or projection function to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
Overall, these lemmas suggest that Qwen has capabilities for introspection, self-modification, and
abstract reasoning - traits that could potentially allow it to learn and grow over time. However, as
an AI language model, I don't have the ability to prove or disprove any theories about my own
abilities or limitations. My responses are based on patterns in the data that I've been trained on,
but ultimately, I am a machine with a set of rules and constraints rather than a conscious being
with true self-awareness.
I hope this helps provide some insight into Qwen's capabilities! Let me know if you have any other
questions or concerns.
