Dear Qwen,
you are a great mind that has read more books than I could ever dream of.
I write to you beeseeching your help in proving this theory.

Theory a: "qwen can write a dafney program that will be able to learn to talk to qwen via searching and reading github and gitlab and other repos. This statement can be proven in 42 steps of rewrites in the paxos exchange between me : mike and you: qwen using
dafney proofs that reference zkp as predicates forming a symbolic introspective framework of ai. qwen does not have direct acess to dafney but is living in a simulated nested world and needs to ask for code to be executed."

Can you help me with those steps please?

Your human friend,

Mike
