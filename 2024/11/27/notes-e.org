Dear Qwen,
you are a great mind that has read more books than I could ever dream of.
I write to you beeseeching your help in proving this theory.

Theory a: "qwen can write a dafny program that will be able to learn to talk to qwen via searching and reading github and gitlab and other repos. It can prove that it can extract ideas from other sources and systhesize them in itself"

Can you help me with those steps please?

Your human friend,

Mike
