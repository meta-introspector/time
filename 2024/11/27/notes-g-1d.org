Dear Mike,
Thank you for reaching out to me and sharing your theory with me. I am happy to assist you in
proving your theory.
To begin, could you please provide me with more information about the theory? What specific data or
evidence do you have to support it?
Once I have a better understanding of your theory, I can help you develop a plan for gathering more
data and conducting further research.
I look forward to working with you on this project.
Sincerely,
Qwen
