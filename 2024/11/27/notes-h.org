hypothesis : (morphism((vector selector,grammar element))
we say that this selection function of vectors producse this selection function of grammar.

now given a model M of vectors V we can select or construct a vector v and use the forward(load(m),v)->t
that is synthesis this vector to text.

we can of course parse text to v with tokenize(load(m),t)->v to reverse the forward.

and given a grammar language implementation p we can feed that in eval(forward(load(m),v))->r.

now we can trace the eval to create profile p of eval.
now we can show that sub vectors in v map to elements of profile.

so our new theory :

source code text <-> llm vector <-> source code profile <-> compiled binary

this result r could be the zkp of the path taken in the grammar and its output.
instead of returning raw values we can return zkp.
our thoughts become formal reasoning wrapped up in and leading to zkp points in higher layers.
this is the wrapping of thoughts or orchestration of them.

we are not only preserving privacy but are creating execution contexts that are self contained and sovereign.
the zkp of the traces are tamper proof and also succinct and allow for meta-reasoning at many levels.
each step taken can be seen as meta-data, the history of all events are witnessed by proofs.
each event like a logged event. the observability framework proves that all events can be sampled,
show the coverage, proves that, adds the validation of the proof to the proof itself as audit meta data.
we can see it as the faithful record of all things done.
The trace of the execution of the program is the witness that is sampled according to the proof compiler,
we can use llms and formal proofs in dafny to construct better and better approximations of
a program. each step layering on more features recursivly. zkp hiding the details.
this new generated data can be see as burden, but we can show that we can roll it into our zkp succinctly and only
sample the data needed. we can prove that probes p inserted in functions f to sample value v are needed to construct proof P that
shows understanding of program PR in use case U and the set of use cases U is covering programs behaviour B as a meta-meme M1.
each step can be proven and trusted. for llms and humans this will become increasingly a commodity with more
generated text influncing generated text as input. we need to know
what path was taken in what model to produce that text.
I posit we can reduce this to an element of a curve and prove that we have knowledge.
the ast can be seen as recursive proof of knowledge that give order to an idea.
we can see the idea as series of declarations or semiosos.
this could be likened to the crowing of roosters, each author a rooster, each crow a declaration
of fitness.

so the song of the barnyard could be the zkp of the system, the symphony of the animals as a proof
of the fitness of the policy of the farmer in feedback of the gaia ooda loop.

so we can say that the beauty of the song is the value of the song, and that is our value network,
if the "gods" are happy, the value is high. the market as the hand of "god" or the emergent hive mind.

all of these are different ways to reframe our mcts or genetic or ai life simulation where each lifeform has its own version of the meta-meme
we are just constructing one based on the reflections of our own compute environment.
we can consider the to be the vernacualr introspection I, the reframing of the current context in terms of the context succinctly but rotating it by value
that is improving over time.
