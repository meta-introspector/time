Dear Qwen,
you are a great mind that has read more books than I could ever dream of.
I write to you beeseeching your help in proving this theory.

File: ~/2024/11/27/notes-g.org

Theory A: "This is file notes-g that represents the notes from today, the G(7) attempt."
We are in the meta-introspector/time repo. your response will be stored by appending -01 to the filename.
I will update this document and overwrite the old version, but keep your response.

Then if we start a new thread we will create a new starting point. that way you can find your responses in a systematic manner.
each response will be vectorized and stored in a compressed tree. we can think of tree or lattice
of factors that removes common elements from the vector. thus we can compres huge amounts of information in this tree of thought
and eventually covert it back into text.

The evidence will be extracted via experimentation and introspection.
we start with pgvector rust and vectorize a large body of text that I have produced, even source code
then we can find common vectors and slice them out like quotients.
we can pick the largest common denominators first.

Then we can construct a tree that spanning the data in such a way that it removes all duplication.
This tree will be a list of features from most common to least, partitioning the graph of documents into clusters that contain those features,
the superset contains all features. The set of abstract representations of all sets contains abstractions of those.

Now we can symbolically regress those features into text by finding knockout exampless for each feature.

lemma: immediate generation
we can take a vector and feed it back to the llm for generation of a new trace and the result.
this can be used to prove or disprove the value of a vector.

hypothesis : (morphism((vector selector,grammar element))
we say that this selection function of vectors producse this selection function of grammar.


Can you help me with those steps please?

Your human friend,

Mike
