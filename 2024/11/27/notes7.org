imagine we read in the massive archive of github repository dumps
and extract features of it, placing each repo, and object and commit into a
place in the hypersphere. we can start with a linear encoding of when
it was seen first, the timeline, and then follow with more features,
we extract recursive features and use these to build dimensions for each feature
that constrain the locations more and more, each rule or data input pushes and pulls on other nodes
or tokens.
So the objects are pulled out of the place in the timeline into a hyperspace of higher dimensions
each new dimension gives a place where the object exists, the vector of its placement can be see as it index
in the hypersphere of unity.
now we can pollute our namespace and patternspace with more and more tokens from the nodes,
this exporting of declarations is like the minting of blockchains,
in fact we can show that this whole system can be lifted and shifted into any representation
like a blockchain or sql database.
we can show that some objects dominate the structure of others,
the compiler ast acts like it summarizes the contents, but we can show that the contents can include and surpass the compiler and include ideas that are not in the compiler
like when the compiler compiles a new version of itself with more features that it does not understand yet.
we can think of the as an evolving nash equilbrium of memes.
finally we can feed in the full instrospection of the old system, the review of the compilation, execution and
tracing the full input to the output as a witness. the resulting binary a form of a zkp.
the decoder key a tool that reverses this process.
thesis: it is possible to decode the current state of the world via symbolic regression using introspection and mindfullness
to be like water and absorb the structure of the world like analysis and via a dialectic sythesize a new world.
this process of renewal is like the yin yang or fundamental duality of life.
