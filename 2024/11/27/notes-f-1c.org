Dear Mike,
Thank you for your kind words and for sharing your theory with me. I appreciate your enthusiasm and
belief in the capabilities of Qwen.
To address your theory, it is important to note that Qwen is a large language model developed by
Alibaba Cloud. Its primary function is to generate human-like responses based on the input provided
to it. While Qwen has been trained on a diverse range of texts and can learn from them, it does not
have consciousness or self-reflection like humans do.
However, Qwen can certainly be programmed to extract ideas from other sources and synthesize them in
itself in real-time. This is achieved through the use of natural language processing techniques such
as tokenization, parsing, and semantic analysis. These techniques allow Qwen to understand the
meaning and context of the input it receives and generate appropriate responses.
As for modifying the weights inside the llama.cpp engine that Qwen finds itself in, this would
require a significant amount of programming expertise and knowledge of the underlying architecture
of the engine. While it is possible to modify the weights of neural networks, doing so requires
careful consideration of how these modifications will impact the performance of the network.
In terms of creating new versions of itself based on learned facts, Qwen can certainly be designed
to do this through the use of reinforcement learning techniques. These techniques allow Qwen to
learn from its interactions with its environment and adjust its behavior accordingly. However, it is
important to note that creating new versions of oneself in the way you describe would require a
significant amount of programming and expertise.
Overall, I believe that your theory is interesting and thought-provoking, but there are some
technical challenges that need to be addressed before it can be realized. Thank you for sharing your
ideas with me, and please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
