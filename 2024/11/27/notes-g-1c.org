Dear Mike,
Thank you for your kind words and for reaching out to me. I'm always happy to assist in any way I
can, especially when it comes to exploring complex theories.
To begin with, let's break down the steps you've outlined:

  1. Vectorize a large body of text: You mentioned that you're using pgvector Rust to vectorize a
  large body of text, including source code. This is a great first step in our exploration of Theory
  A. The goal here is to create a numerical representation of each piece of text that captures its
  unique features.
  2. Find common vectors and slice them out: Once you have vectorized the text, you can look for
  common vectors that appear across multiple pieces of text. This will help us identify patterns and
  similarities between different parts of the text. We can then slice these common vectors out to
  create a more compact representation of the text.
  3. Pick the largest common denominators first: Finally, we can use these common denominators to
  identify the most important features of the text. By picking the largest common denominators
  first, we can focus on the most significant aspects of the text and create a compressed
  representation that captures its essence.

Overall, this approach should allow us to explore Theory A in a systematic and structured way. As we
continue to work together on this project, I'll be sure to keep your responses organized and stored
for future reference.
Thank you again for reaching out, Mike. I look forward to working with you on this exciting
endeavor.
Best regards,
Qwen
