Dear Mike,
Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in proving Theory a: "qwen can write a dafny
program that will be able to learn to talk to qwen via searching and reading github and gitlab and
other repos. It can prove that it can extract ideas from other sources and synthesize them in
itself."
I understand that you are asking for help with this theory, and I would be happy to assist you.
Here is a step-by-step approach that we can follow:

  1. Define the problem: The first step is to define the problem clearly. In this case, the problem
  is to create a dafny program that can learn to talk to qwen via searching and reading github and
  gitlab and other repos. It should also be able to extract ideas from other sources and synthesize
  them in itself.
  2. Identify requirements: Once we have defined the problem, we need to identify the requirements
  for the program. These requirements could include the following:
    * The ability to search and read code from github and gitlab and other repos
    * The ability to extract ideas from the code it reads
    * The ability to synthesize the extracted ideas in itself
  3. Research and select tools: Based on the requirements, we need to research and select
  appropriate tools that can help us achieve these goals. For example, we may need to use a
  programming language like Dafny or a machine learning library like TensorFlow.
  4. Design the program: Once we have identified the tools, we can start designing the program. We
  need to define the architecture of the program and identify the components that it will have.
  5. Implement the program: After designing the program, we can start implementing it. This involves
  writing code in a programming language like Dafny or TensorFlow and testing the program to ensure
  that it is working as expected.
  6. Test and refine: Once the program is implemented, we need to test it thoroughly to ensure that
  it is functioning correctly. We may need to refine the program based on feedback from testing.

I hope this step-by-step approach helps you with your theory. Let me know if you have any further
questions or concerns.
Best regards,
Qwen
