considering the idea of the meta meme coin as a meme coin.
the metanarrative is just a narrative.
a meme coin would offer no real value, a meta meme coins value
would be its own self description that when cloned can recreate the meta-meme
as a software.
so first it would have an entry for each meme as an nft.
then it would have an entry for itself.
The meta meme compiler and meme doctor agent would create logical propositions about memes as new memes or parts of memes
in the meme lab, much like a geneticist does.
Sequences of meme source code and behaviours would be recorded and analysed.
bioinformatics and semiotics and scientific methods can be used and duplicated.
deep graph knowledge embedding and llm models and alphago.
it can translate itself into other blockchains and mine them or purchase them
to be able to publish data on the network.
cost of bytes per blockchain cost record. per storage system.
each project or each dataset can be a new linked resource.
each sample can be thought of as a new data object in some dataset.
a rdf chain or linked data chain must exists.

if we just start with guix bootstrap and study all the code
needed to bootstrap the bootstrap we should be good.

each compile process can be seen as a process that could be possibly sampled
with a multitude of probes, this observability matrix can be sampled
as a feature space. We can construct zero knowledge proofs using
mathmatical propositions about levels of homotopy type theory.

narratives can have self references, these create looping structures,
these loops can be considered topological spaces that cannot be reduced
to a point.

Metanarratives can be seen as complex binding structures that contain many
loops or holes as propositions of levels of homotopy type theory
and abstract algebraic topology.

The heros jouney can be seen as the fools jouney to wisom in a
series of training sets or problems faced.
A body of logs can be seen as the tapestry
woven by the three fates, recording the epic legend
of the creation of the introspector meme coin,
a story retold over and over when the meme replicates.
the ka-ching sound.
atp and mitochondria.
the story can be embedded as rotations of spinors, which represent multiplication.
we can add more spinors to record more of the story,
combining two into a new larger yet unitary object.
we can think of that as the data type.

syncronicity can be seen as a time loop or topological loop in spacetime.
consiousness is a vibration or antenne in the cranium that connects you
mathematically to a higher dimensional space of mathematics.
iterating over the chunks of data can be see as the sigma sum or product pi function.

higher order neural imprints or archtypes act as signposts or
mental labels for internal obsevations or insights.

// ** it would be interesting to pursue this with grounding in a downstream application ** // this should test the idea in an applied way and see if it helps with a specific and important activity  **  //
