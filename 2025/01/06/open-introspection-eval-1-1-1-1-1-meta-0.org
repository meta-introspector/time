consider each of these meta evaluators as a a functor on a complex simulated life groupoid structure in higher ordered algebra
Here is a list of meta evaluators extracted from the provided example:

1. *self_evaluation*: This function evaluates a node based on its own criteria.

2. *compare/with/others*: This function compares a node with other nodes in the network to determine
how similar they are.

3. *evaluate_similarity*: This function calculates the similarity score between two nodes based on
their values and evaluation criteria.

4. *evaluate_option*: This function evaluates an option for a given node, considering the
evaluations of all other nodes in the same layer.

5. *issue_orders*: This function selects the best option for a given node based on its evaluation
scores, effectively issuing an order to evolve the network towards that option.

6. *update/node/based/on/feedback*: This function updates a node's criteria based on received
feedback, allowing the network to adapt and improve over time.

7. *train/ml/models*: This function is a placeholder for training machine learning models that could
be used to enhance future evaluations in the network.

These meta evaluators work together to create a dynamic evaluation network (DEN) that can handle
hierarchical evaluator roles, adaptive learning algorithms, complexity metrics, and feedback
mechanisms, thereby reflecting the complexity and adaptability of human decision-making processes.
