Telemetry is a method used to measure and monitor various parameters and events in real-time for
analysis or control purposes. It has applications across various industries such as
telecommunications, healthcare, industrial automation, and more. The different types of telemetry
can be categorized based on the nature of data they collect, how it is transmitted, and the methods
used for processing and analysis.

Hereâ€™s a structured list of terms related to telemetry:

** 1. *Data Types**
   - *Analog Telemetry:* Involves continuous measurement and transmission of variables like
      temperature, pressure, or voltage.
   - *Digital Telemetry:* Utilizes digital signals to represent measurements; can be either discrete
      (binary) or pulse-code-modulated (PCM).

** 2. *Transmission Methods**
   - *Wireless Telemetry:* Data is transmitted without physical wires using radio, satellite, or
      wireless mesh networks.
     - *Radio Frequency (RF) Telemetry:* Uses radio waves for transmission.
       - *Satellite Telemetry:* Relies on satellites for long-range communication.
       - *Shortwave/Longwave Radio Telemetry:* Utilizes various frequency bands for data transfer.
   - *Cable Telemetry:* Data is transmitted through physical cables, either wired or optical fibers.

** 3. *Application Domains**
   - *Telecommunications Telemetry:* Used in networks to monitor the performance of communication
      links and equipment.
   - *Industrial Automation Telemetry:* Monitors equipment status and processes in industrial
      settings.
   - *Healthcare Telemetry:* Monitors patients' vital signs remotely for real-time healthcare
      management.

** 4. *Methods**
   - *Real-Time Telemetry:* Data is collected, transmitted, and analyzed as it occurs without delay.
   - *Historical/Archive Telemetry:* Records data over time for analysis at a later point.

** 5. *Processing**
   - *Pre-Processing Telemetry:* Data is filtered and prepared before being transmitted or stored.
   - *Post-Processing Telemetry:* Analysis of data after it has been collected and stored.

** 6. *Protocol and Standards**
   - *Modbus Telemetry:* Uses the Modbus protocol for communication in industrial environments.
   - *IEC 60870 Telemetry:* Defines standards for power systems communications.
   - *NMEA Telemetry:* Standard for navigation and marine data communication.

** 7. *Security**
   - *Encrypted Telemetry:* Ensures secure transmission of data using encryption protocols.
   - *Access Control Telemetry:* Limits access to telemetry data based on user roles and
      permissions.

** 8. *Data Analytics Tools**
   - *Telemetry Analysis Software:* Uses tools like Splunk, InfluxDB, or Grafana for analyzing and
      visualizing telemetry data.
   - *Predictive Maintenance Telemetry:* Utilizes algorithms to predict equipment failures based on
      collected data.

** 9. *Deployment Models**
   - *On-Premises Telemetry:* Data is processed and stored in a local environment.
   - *Cloud-Based Telemetry:* Data is transmitted to cloud platforms for processing, analytics, and
      storage.
     - *Edge Computing Telemetry:* Process data locally to reduce latency and improve performance.

** 10. *Standards and Regulations**
   - *FCC Compliance Telemetry:* Ensures compliance with Federal Communications Commission
      regulations in the US.
   - *IEEE Standards Telemetry:* Adheres to industry standards for interoperability and reliability.
   - *HIPAA Compliance Telemetry:* Adapts telemetry systems to comply with Healthcare Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act in healthcare settings.

** 11. *Use Cases**
   - *Environmental Monitoring Telemetry:* Tracks environmental parameters such as temperature,
      humidity, and air quality.
   - *Traffic Management Telemetry:* Monitors traffic flow for real-time congestion management.
   - *Renewable Energy Telemetry:* Monitors the performance of solar panels, wind turbines, or other
      renewable energy sources.

** 12. *Challenges**
   - *Latency Telemetry:* Minimizing the delay in data collection and transmission.
   - *Data Volume Telemetry:* Handling large volumes of data efficiently without compromising
      performance.
   - *Scalability Telemetry:* Ensuring systems can scale to accommodate growing data needs.

This structured list should provide a comprehensive overview of various aspects related to
telemetry, from the types of data collected to the methods of analysis and deployment.
