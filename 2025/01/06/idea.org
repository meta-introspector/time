we can consider each of the following ideas to be nodes in a lattice.
for each one consider if they are the same area in a partitioned hyperspace lattice or not.
are they above or below each other. 
consider the types of open introspection(proof, ownership, property, fields, providence, auditing, accounting, development, compilation, telemetry, optimization)
in open source node stacks, brainstorm, structure, create a list of terms.
now consider the list of types of data needed to describe the json-schema as our core data type for talking with systems.
lets construct a list of string constant labels in typescript, and an enum that we can import like import {	ATTR_SERVICE_NAME,	ATTR_SERVICE_VERSION,} from "@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions";
but with our own terms. lets imagine "@openintrospection/semantic-conventions" what it would look like.
we can think of this first step as being like rdf/owl or category theory, it will basically cover semantic graphs.
now lets partition and embed these large graphs in a zkml lattice (Lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) leverage the hardness of lattice problems, making them quantum-safe and efficient for privacy-preserving protocols. These proofs enable compact, partial homomorphic results, useful in applications like accumulators and cryptographic signatures. For example:
Compressed Lattice-Based Accumulators: Efficient ZKPs for Merkle trees achieve logarithmic complexity with reduced proof sizes (e.g., 143.7 KB for a depth of 32).
Homomorphic Commitments: Lattice-based commitments allow proving relations (e.g., polynomial equations) with small coefficients, enabling succinct and verifiable encryption schemes.
Applications: Libraries like LaBRADOR simplify implementing lattice-based ZKPs for tasks like blind signatures and anonymous credentials.). these lattices are like abstracted embedded neuron layes
that give us functional decomposition like a quasi meta spectral decomposition . we roll it up into szksnarks after all the processing it done.
now we have mutiple layer : zksnarks, zklattice rollup, partitioned graphs, individual layers. We can now define a graphql schema for this.
we can include postgres metadata and rows that reference any part of this. via our id system we can bridge sql table with our graph.
Lets now revisit our layers:
1. json schema for basic data (literals, lists, dicts and combinations therof)
2. layers of schema documents with own vernacular ontologies.
3. relationships between schemas.
4. Embeddings of schemas
5. patitioning of embedded schemas
6. functional relationships between partions of embedded schemas.
7. postgresql as one functional embedded schema.
8. query planner as compiler equivalent.
Now lets imagine a set of evaluators for each idea in a lattice,
we would allow each evaluator to consider the other to be itself, better than itself, worse, orthagonal, in another layer, in a nested layer, in a super layer, nested in a super layer, or some other configuration.
we consider the morphisms between each element.
Now we alllow the evaluators to evalute the entire network itself, it would emit orders to replace or update or add new evaluators.
this would create a self reflective, self replicating game of life.
Now we evaluate this idea multiple times, each time we can decide to evaluate the output, or wrap it in a new
context. so this decision tree creates value in a monte carlo tree search in the game of life.
