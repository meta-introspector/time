Here's a brainstormed list of TypeScript string constant labels and an enum for describing open
introspection concepts in the context of Open Source Node Stacks, structured as you requested:
TypeScript Constant Labels:
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
export const ATTR_SERVICE_NAME = "service.name";
export const ATTR_SERVICE_VERSION = "service.version";
export const ATTR_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE = "environment.type";
export const ATTR_LANGUAGE_NAME = "language.name";
export const ATTR_NODE_VERSION = "node.version";
export const ATTR_OS_PLATFORM = "os.platform";
export const ATTR_COMPILER_VERSION = "compiler.version";
export const ATTR_TELEMETRY_ENABLED = "telemetry.enabled";
export const ATTR_ACCOUNTING_MODE = "accounting.mode";
export const ATTR_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = "optimization.level";
#+END_SRC
TypeScript Enum:
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
export enum OpenIntrospectionAttribute {
  SERVICE_NAME = "service.name",
  SERVICE_VERSION = "service.version",
  ENVIRONMENT_TYPE = "environment.type",
  LANGUAGE_NAME = "language.name",
  NODE_VERSION = "node.version",
  OS_PLATFORM = "os.platform",
  COMPILER_VERSION = "compiler.version",
  TELEMETRY_ENABLED = "telemetry.enabled",
  ACCOUNTING_MODE = "accounting.mode",
  OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = "optimization.level"
}
#+END_SRC
These labels and enum can be imported in other files using the following syntax:
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
import { ATTR_SERVICE_NAME, OpenIntrospectionAttribute } from
"@openintrospection/semantic-conventions";
#+END_SRC
You can use these terms to describe open introspection concepts in JSON-Schema as your core data
type for talking with systems.
