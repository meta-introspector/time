Certainly! OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to help organizations
instrument their applications and services to gain insights into how they operate. When it comes to
using OpenTelemetry with Node.js applications, there are several types of telemetry data you can
collect. Below is a list of key terms related to the types of telemetry in the Open Source Node
Stack:

*** Types of Telemetry

1. *Tracing (Distributed Tracing)*
   - *Span*: A single unit of work that's executed in a distributed tracing system.
   - *Trace*: A collection of spans that are logically related and trace the execution path from end
      to end.
   - *Sampler*: Determines which traces should be recorded and sent for analysis.
   - *Propagator*: Transmits tracing information across service boundaries (e.g., HTTP headers, gRPC
      metadata).

2. *Metrics*
   - *Counter*: A metric that increments monotonically over time.
   - *Gauge*: A metric that represents a single instantaneous value.
   - *Histogram*: A histogram is an accurate distribution of values in a finite set of buckets.
   - *Summary*: Similar to a histogram, but it provides quantiles (e.g., 0.5, 0.9, 0.99) of the
      recorded values.

3. *Logging*
   - *Log Record*: A single event with attributes.
   - *Logger*: An interface for emitting logs.
   - *Log Level*: The severity level of a log record (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).
   - *Log Handler*: A component that defines how logs are output or stored.

4. *Resource*
   - *Resource*: Contains metadata about the system on which the telemetry data is generated (e.g.,
      host name, container ID).

5. *Instrumentation*
   - *Auto-Instrumentation*: Automatically instruments Node.js libraries to capture telemetry.
   - *Manual Instrumentation*: Manually adding instrumentation code in application code.

6. *Exporter*
   - *Exporter*: Sends collected telemetry data to a backend system for analysis (e.g., Jaeger,
      Prometheus).

7. *Processor*
   - *Span Processor*: Defines what happens with spans after they are created but before they are
      exported.
   - *Metric Processor*: Defines what happens with metrics after they are recorded but before they
      are exported.

8. *SDK (Software Development Kit)*
   - *OpenTelemetry SDK for Node.js*: The official SDK for instrumenting Node.js applications with
      OpenTelemetry.
