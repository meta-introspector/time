*** Summary and Detailed Explanation

**** EnumSchema Definition
- *Purpose*: Converts TypeScript enum structures into JSON Schema format.
- *Complexity*: Handles simple enums and nested enums up to 100 levels.

**** ASTtoJSONSchema Transformation Function
- *Role*: Transforms a TypeScript Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into an EnumSchema.
- *Process*: Iterates through the AST nodes, converting enum or symbol nodes into JSON Schema
   representations.

**** LanguageDef Syntax
- *Definition*: A syntax used to define languages composed of symbols that can represent enum
   values.
  - *Examples*: Symbols can be strings ("RED"), numbers (GÃ¶del numbers), etc., depending on the
     language's requirements.

**** DAG Representation for Regex Languages
- *Purpose*: Efficiently represents and evaluates simple regex languages using a Directed Acyclic
   Graph (DAG).
- *Efficiency*: Supports linear-time evaluation of regex patterns, making it suitable for various
   applications requiring robust string pattern matching.

*** Examples

**** Converting a TypeScript Enum to JSON Schema

*** TypeScript Enum
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
enum Color {
  RED,
  GREEN,
  BLUE
}
#+END_SRC

*** AST Representation (Simplified)
- *Node ~Color~*: Type = "enum", Children = ["RED", "GREEN", "BLUE"]
- *Nodes ~RED~, ~GREEN~, ~BLUE~*: Type = "symbol", Value = Corresponding string values ("RED",
   "GREEN", "BLUE")

*** JSON Schema
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "type": "enum",
  "values": ["RED", "GREEN", "BLUE"]
}
#+END_SRC

**** Example with Nested Enums

*** TypeScript Enum
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
enum Status {
  ACTIVE,
  INACTIVE,
  SUBSTATUS = {
    CURRENT,
    PENDING
  }
}
#+END_SRC

*** AST Representation (Simplified)
- *Node ~Status~*: Type = "enum", Values = ["ACTIVE", "INACTIVE", { "type": "enum", "values":
   ["CURRENT", "PENDING"] }]
- *Nodes ~ACTIVE~, ~INACTIVE~*: Type = "symbol", Value = Corresponding string values ("ACTIVE",
   "INACTIVE")
- *Node ~SUBSTATUS~*: Type = "enum", Values = ["CURRENT", "PENDING"]

*** JSON Schema
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "type": "enum",
  "values": [
    "ACTIVE",
    "INACTIVE",
    {
      "type": "enum",
      "values": ["CURRENT", "PENDING"]
    }
  ]
}
#+END_SRC

**** Example with DAG Representation for Regex Languages

*** Simple Regex Language (DAG)
- *Vertices (States)*: Start, A, B, C, End
- *Edges*: (Start -> A), (A -> B), (B -> C), (C -> End)

*Evaluation*:
- If the current state is "End" after processing the string, the input is accepted.
- Otherwise, it is rejected.

This DAG structure allows for efficient regex evaluation in linear time by following the transitions
based on input symbols.

*** Conclusion
The formalization provided offers a comprehensive system for converting TypeScript enums to JSON
Schema representations and represents them in various forms. The use of DAGs for simple regex
evaluation ensures both expressive power and efficiency. This system is well-suited for applications
that require robust string pattern matching and flexible enum handling.

This detailed explanation should help anyone understand how TypeScript enums can be effectively
converted into a form suitable for JSON Schema, and highlights the benefits of using graph-based
representations for efficient language evaluations.
