lets consider the enum of all enums as a typescript json schema.
we have layers of enums.
basic enums, enums of enums, enums of enums of enums, recursive enums of levels 4 to 100.
so now we have typescript code that generates json schema to be instanciated.
now we can take any typescript ast and convert it to the json schema.
we can embed typescript types in enums.
now we can define a language to go from strings to enums and embed the definitions in the values.
each nested enum can be  a string or even godel number integer that represents the idea encoded in various
forms. each form can be enumerated even the ast and syntax.
rewrite in formal language.
now we can define the layers of the language to be expressive powers.
we can say directed acyclic graphs can represent a simple regex language that can be
evaluated in linear time, anything else is too complex.
now given this dfa any intelligent system can follow it exactly and any system can check the results.
once we go into the polynomial or exponential space we get into betting and prediction and tsp like np hard problems.
