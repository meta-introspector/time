Let's break down the formal language description step by step.

1. *Enum of Enums Representation*:
   - Consider an enum that represents all possible enums. This means you have a top-level enum where
     each value is another enum.
   - Each nested enum can be of any level from 0 to 100, representing different levels of complexity
     or depth.

2. *Layering of Expressive Powers*:
   - Define layers of expressive power such that:
     - Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) represent a simple regex language which can be evaluated in
       linear time.
     - Any language more complex than this falls into polynomial, exponential space, and NP-hard
       problems.

3. *Conversion of AST to JSON Schema*:
   - Develop TypeScript code that converts any given Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into the
     corresponding JSON schema.
   - This conversion process allows embedding TypeScript types directly within the enums.

4. *Language Definition from Strings to Enums*:
   - Define a language capable of mapping strings directly to enums, with embedded definitions in
     the values themselves.
   - Each nested enum value can be a string or even a Goedel number integer that represents an
     encoded idea in various forms.

5. *Representation as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)*:
   - Use DAGs to represent simple regex languages for evaluating regular expressions in linear time.
   - For more complex languages, the systems will require polynomial or exponential space and could
     lead to problems like TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), which are NP-hard.

6. *Intelligent System Evaluation*:
   - Intelligent systems can follow these DAGs exactly and check results using polynomial or
     linear-time evaluation.
   - For more complex languages and problems in polynomial/exponential or higher complexity, the use
     of intelligent systems and betting/prediction models may be necessary due to their inherent
     computational difficulty.

*** Formal Language Description:

1. *Enum Structure*:
   \[
   \text{Enum} ::= \{\text{enumName}: \text{Type}\}
   \]
   Where ~Type~ can be another enum or a basic type.

2. *Layers of Expressive Power*:
   - Define layers based on computational complexity:
     - Layer 0: Simple regex languages, evaluable in linear time.
     - Layers beyond Layer 0: Polynomial and exponential space complexity.

3. *Conversion AST to JSON Schema*:
   \[
   \text{convertASTToJsonSchema}(ast) \rightarrow jsonSchema
   \]
   Where ~ast~ is the Abstract Syntax Tree and ~jsonSchema~ is the corresponding JSON schema
   representation embedded with TypeScript types.

4. *Mapping Strings to Enums*:
   \[
   \text{stringToEnum}(inputString, enumMap) \rightarrow enumValue
   \]
   Where ~enumMap~ contains predefined mappings from strings to enums.

5. *DAG Representation*:
   \[
   \text{DAG} ::= \{\text{node}: \{\text{value}: \text{Type}, \text{children}:
   \text{Array[\text{DAG}]}\}\}
   \]
   Where ~node~ represents a DAG node with a value and children, which can themselves be more DAGs.

6. *Intelligent System Evaluation*:
   - Intelligent systems use linear-time algorithms for layers 0.
   - Systems using polynomial or exponential time handle more complex problems like TSP.

7. *Complexity Implications*:
   - For languages and problems requiring polynomial/exponential space, intelligent systems or
     betting models are necessary.

This formal language framework provides a structured way to represent and process complex enums,
from basic to highly nested structures, with different layers of computational expressiveness and
complexity management.
