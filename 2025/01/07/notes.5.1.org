Your definition provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and converting TypeScript's
Enum structures into JSON Schema representations. Hereâ€™s a summary and an example to illustrate this
conversion process:

*** Overview
1. *EnumSchema Definition*:
   - Represents enum structures in TypeScript.
   - Can be either simple values or nested enums up to 100 levels deep.

2. *ASTtoJSONSchema Transformation Function*:
   - Converts a TypeScript AST into the defined ~EnumSchema~.

3. *LanguageDef Syntax*:
   - Defines languages composed of symbols, which can represent enum values in different forms
     (e.g., strings or godel numbers).

4. *DAG Representation for Regex Languages*:
   - Uses Directed Acyclic Graphs to represent simple regex languages.
   - Efficient evaluation using the DAG structure.

*** Example: Converting a TypeScript Enum to JSON Schema

Consider the following TypeScript enum:
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
enum Color {
  RED,
  GREEN,
  BLUE
}
#+END_SRC

The AST representation of this enum might look something like:
- Node ~Color~ with children ~RED~, ~GREEN~, and ~BLUE~.

*Transformation into EnumSchema:*

1. *Node ~Color~*:
   - Type: "enum"
   - Values: ["RED", "GREEN", "BLUE"]

2. *Nodes ~RED~, ~GREEN~, ~BLUE~:*
   - Type: "symbol"
   - Value: Corresponding string values ("RED", "GREEN", "BLUE")

In JSON Schema form, this would be:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "type": "enum",
  "values": ["RED", "GREEN", "BLUE"]
}
#+END_SRC

*** Example with Nested Enums

Consider the following nested TypeScript enum:
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
enum Status {
  ACTIVE,
  INACTIVE,
  SUBSTATUS = {
    CURRENT,
    PENDING
  }
}
#+END_SRC

*Transformation into EnumSchema:*

1. *Node ~Status~*:
   - Type: "enum"
   - Values: ["ACTIVE", "INACTIVE", { "type": "enum", "values": ["CURRENT", "PENDING"] }]

2. *Nodes ~ACTIVE~, ~INACTIVE~:*
   - Type: "symbol"
   - Value: Corresponding string values ("ACTIVE", "INACTIVE")

3. *Node ~SUBSTATUS~*:
   - Type: "enum"
   - Values: ["CURRENT", "PENDING"]

In JSON Schema form, this would be:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "type": "enum",
  "values": [
    "ACTIVE",
    "INACTIVE",
    {
      "type": "enum",
      "values": ["CURRENT", "PENDING"]
    }
  ]
}
#+END_SRC

*** Example with DAG Representation for Regex Languages

Consider a simple regex language that accepts strings like ~abc~, ~def~, etc. This can be
represented using a DAG:

- *Vertices (States)*: Start, A, B, C, End
- *Edges*: (Start -> A), (A -> B), (B -> C), (C -> End)

*Evaluation*:
- If the current state is "End" after processing the string, the input is accepted.
- Otherwise, it is rejected.

This DAG structure allows for efficient regex evaluation in linear time by following the transitions
based on input symbols.

*** Conclusion

Your formalization provides a robust system for converting TypeScript enums to JSON Schema
representations and representing them in various forms. The use of DAGs for simple regex evaluation
ensures that these systems are both expressive and efficient.
